# Flask Photography

A small demo site using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The home page represents a feed of stock images. Users can create an account and login to click the heart icon on a picture from the feed to add it into their profiles "liked collection". Admin users can perform CRUD operations on the User and Image table.
